# Genetic-Pseudo-Rehearsal
The repository is an official implementation of the paper  Pseudo Rehearsal using non-photo realistic images. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13414.pdf"> Link to paper.</a>

There are three implementations of the work. 
1. MNIST_Fashion_demo.ipynb: The entire code has been implemented in the notebook and was demonstrated on MNIST Fashion dataset by generating synthetic data for it and training a fresh neural network for it. Please refer to the paper for full details about the experiment. The .ipynb file can be readily used in Google colab environment.
2. Genetic_Rehearsal.py: The user can make the necessary function calls to implement the code. All the code for generating synthetic data and required supporting functions are implemented in this file.
3. The code has been implemented as an API and can be accessed via the following URL (TO BE ADDED)

# Intructions to run the .ipynb notebook:

Step 1: Upload the "Genetic_rehearsal.py" file to your working directory. If you are using google colab, upload it to runtime or mount it using your Google Drive.<br>
Step 2: Make sure that you are using Tensorflow 1.x version to run the file.<br>
Step 3: Run the .ipynb file.

Note:: The code to generate the synthetic data is in the .ipynb notebook itself. "Genetic_rehearsal.py" is being imported for some supporting functions.
