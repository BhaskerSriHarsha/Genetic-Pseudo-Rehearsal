Contains ready to be used codes to perform Genetic Pseudo Rehearsal

In Genetic_Rehearsal.py you will find ready to use function calls to perform Genetic Pseudo Rehearsal.
The repository also contains "Experiment.ipynb" file which contains the experiments that validate the Genetic Pseudo Rehearsal concept.

# Intructions to run the .ipynb file:

Step 1: Upload the "Genetic_rehearsal.py" file to your working directory. If you are using google colab, upload it to runtime or mount it using your Google Drive.<br>
Step 2: Make sure that you are using Tensorflow 1.x version to run the file.<br>
